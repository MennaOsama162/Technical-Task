Full Stack CRUD Operation Documentation for Clients Management System

Overview
This document explains the implementation of a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation for managing client data using a database-first approach. The system comprises a backend API built with ASP.NET Core, following the repository and unit of work design patterns, and a frontend application developed with Angular.

Database Schema
The database schema involves a table named Client to store client data. It includes fields such as Client name, description, job title, sales representative, and more. Triggers are used to automatically set the insertion and update timestamps

Backend Implementation
⦁	Repository Pattern
The repository pattern abstracts the data access layer, providing a clean separation between business logic and data access code. This promotes maintainability and code reuse. By using a generic repository, CRUD operations can be implemented once and reused for different entities.

⦁	Unit of Work Pattern
The unit of work pattern is employed to manage transactions and ensure that all operations within a single transaction are committed or rolled back together. This pattern helps maintain data integrity by coordinating the work of multiple repositories.

Controllers
The controllers handle HTTP requests and responses. They interact with the repositories via the unit of work, ensuring that business logic is decoupled from data access logic. Each controller method corresponds to a CRUD operation, providing endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employees.

Frontend Implementation
The frontend, developed using Angular, provides a user interface for interacting with the backend API. It includes components for displaying a list of Client s, and forms for adding and editing Client information. The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests, displaying data dynamically and updating the UI based on user interactions.

Design Patterns Used
⦁	Repository Pattern
Why it was used:
Separation of Concerns: The repository pattern separates the data access logic from the business logic, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
Code Reusability: Generic repositories allow for the reuse of CRUD operations across different entities, reducing code duplication.
Testability: Abstracting data access logic facilitates unit testing by allowing the use of mock repositories.

⦁	Unit of Work Pattern
Why it was used:
Transaction Management: The unit of work pattern ensures that multiple operations are committed or rolled back as a single transaction, maintaining data integrity.
Coordination: It coordinates the work of multiple repositories, ensuring a consistent state within a transaction.
Scalability: By encapsulating transaction logic, it simplifies the process of scaling and managing complex operations.

SOLID Principles Applied
⦁	Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Explanation:
Each class has a single responsibility. For instance, the repository classes handle data access, the unit of work class manages transactions, and the controllers handle HTTP requests. This adherence to SRP makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

⦁	Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Explanation:
The repository classes are open for extension but closed for modification. We can extend the functionality of the GenericRepo by creating new repositories that inherit from it without modifying the existing code.

⦁	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Explanation:
High-level modules (controllers) do not depend on low-level modules (concrete repository implementations); instead, both depend on abstractions. This is achieved using dependency injection, making the system more flexible and easier to test by allowing the use of mock implementations.

Conclusion
The implementation of a full-stack CRUD operation for managing Client data adheres to best practices and design patterns that ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability. The use of the repository and unit of work patterns, along with adherence to SOLID principles, creates a robust and flexible architecture that can be easily extended and maintained.
